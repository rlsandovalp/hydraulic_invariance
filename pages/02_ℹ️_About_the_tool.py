This tool was developed by [Leonardo Sandoval](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafael-leonardo-sandoval-pab%C3%B3n-6a04b89b/) to estimate hyetographs for hydrological studies, following the LSPP (Linee Segnalatrici di Possibilit√† Pluviometrica) methodology typically employed in the Lombardy region of Italy.

The tool request information of the effective parameters of the LSPP method for a given area as well as the total duration of the rain, the time intervals for which you want to recover the precipitation, the position of the peak $r$, and the return period. Then it calculates the rain depth for an uniform hyetogram and a Chicago hyetogram, plotting the results. The user can download the hyetogram data than can then be used in SWMM (or any other software) for further analysis.
